<p class = "sansserif"><b>8.1 ABOUT FILES</b></p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    While a program is running, its data is stored in random access memory (RAM). RAM is fast and inexpensive, but it is also volatile, which means that when the program ends, or the computer shuts down, data in RAM disappears. To make data available the next time the computer is turned on and the program is started, it has to be written to a non-volatile storage medium, such a hard drive, usb drive, or DVD.
    <br>
    Data on non-volatile storage media is stored in named locations on the media called files. By reading and writing files, programs can save information between program runs.
    <br>
    Working with files is a lot like working with a notebook. To use a notebook, it has to be opened. When done, it has to be closed. While the notebook is open, it can either be read from or written to. In either case, the notebook holder knows where they are. They can read the whole notebook in its natural order or they can skip around.
   <br>
   All of this applies to files as well. To open a file, we specify its name and indicate whether we want to read or write.
</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>8.2 WRITING OUR FIRST FILE</b></p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    Opening a file creates what we call a file handle. In this example, the variable myfile refers to the new handle object. Our program calls methods on the handle, and this makes changes to the actual file which is usually located on our disk.
    <br>
    On line 1, the open function takes two arguments. The first is the name of the file, and the second is the mode. Mode "w" means that we are opening the file for writing.
    <br>
    With mode "w", if there is no file named test.txt on the disk, it will be created. If there already is one, it will be replaced by the file we are writing.
    <br>
    To put data in the file we invoke the write method on the handle, shown in lines 2, 3 and 4 above. In bigger programs, lines 2–4 will usually be replaced by a loop that writes many more lines into the file.
    <br>
    Closing the file handle (line 5) tells the system that we are done writing and makes the disk file available for reading by other programs (or by our own program).
</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>8.3 READING A LINE AT A TIME</b></p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    This is a handy pattern for our toolbox. In bigger programs, we’d squeeze more extensive logic into the body of the loop at line 8 — for example, if each line of the file contained the name and email address of one of our friends, perhaps we’d split the line into some pieces and call a function to send the friend a party invitation.
    <br>
    On line 8 we suppress the newline character that print usually appends to our strings. Why? This is because the string already has its own newline: the readline method in line 3 returns everything up to and including the newline character. This also explains the end-of-file detection logic: when there are no more lines to be read from the file, readline returns an empty string — one that does not even have a newline at the end, hence its length is 0.
