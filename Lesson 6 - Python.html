    Python is one of the most preferred languages out there. Its brevity and high readability makes it so popular among all programmers.
    <br>
    So here are few of the tips and tricks you can use to bring up your Python programming game.
    <br>
    1. Check your code for errors, logic programs, and bugs!
    <br>
    2. If you run into errors, write print statements to debug your code.
    <br>
    3. The data type “set” is a kind of collection. If you are trying to calculate something, but there are errors double check the type of the variables by printing, print(type(variable)).
    <br>
    4. In Java, C++, and other statically typed languages, you have to specify the data type of the function return value as well as the kind of each function argument. On the other hand, Python is a dynamically typed language. In Python, you don’t explicitly provide the data types. Based on the value you’ve assigned, Python keeps track of the datatype internally.
    <br>
    5. Python allows for conditional expressions. Remember you are having the logic and ordering of your if statements correctly for logic errors.
    <br>
    6. To keep your programs manageable as they grow, you may want to break them up into several files. Python allows you to put multiple function definitions into a file and use them as a module. You can import these modules into other scripts and programs. These files must have a .py extension.
    <br>
    7. Consistency is very important when you are learning a new language. We recommend making a commitment to code every day. It may be hard to believe, but muscle memory plays a large part in programming. Committing to coding everyday will really help develop that muscle memory. Though it may seem daunting at first, consider starting small with 25 minutes everyday and working your way up from there.
    <br>
    8. As you progress on your journey as a new programmer, you may wonder if you should be taking notes. Yes, you should! In fact, research suggests that taking notes by hand is most beneficial for long-term retention. This will be especially beneficial for those working towards the goal of becoming a full-time developer, as many interviews will involve writing code on a whiteboard. Once you start working on small projects and programs, writing by hand can also help you plan your code before you move to the computer. You can save a lot of time if you write out which functions and classes you will need, as well as how they will interact.
    <br>
    9. When you are learning, it is important to step away and absorb the concepts. The Pomodoro Technique is widely used and can help: you work for 25 minutes, take a short break, and then repeat the process. Taking breaks is critical to having an effective study session, particularly when you are taking in a lot of new information.

Breaks are especially important when you are debugging. If you hit a bug and can’t quite figure out what is going wrong, take a break. Step away from your computer, go for a walk, or chat with a friend.

In programming, your code must follow the rules of a language and logic exactly, so even missing a quotation mark will break everything. Fresh eyes make a big difference.
    <br>
    10. Though coding may seem like a solitary activity, it actually works best when you work together. It is extremely important when you are learning to code in Python that you surround yourself with other people who are learning as well. This will allow you to share the tips and tricks you learn along the way.
    <br>
    11. It is said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. This is true when you are learning Python. There are many ways to do this: whiteboarding with other Python lovers, writing blog posts explaining newly learned concepts, recording videos in which you explain something you learned, or simply talking to yourself at your computer. Each of these strategies will solidify your understanding as well as expose any gaps in your understanding.
