<center><p class = "sansserif">Welcome! If you're struggling or trying to learn how to code in Scratch, Python, or HTML, we're here to help.</p></center>
<center><h2 class = "sansserif" style = background-color:PowderBlue;>Python</h2></center>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.1 VALUES</b></br>A value is something that a program can manipulate. There are different classes that these values can be categorized as. The different classes, also known as data types, are integers(int), string(str), and float. Strings are places in quotations marks while integers are what they sound like, integers. Floats however, are decimals. So if we have 3.0, that is still considered a float. Values like “2” or “7.9” are still strings because they’re placed inside quotes!</p>
<p class = "sansserif">When typing integers, you cannot use commas like “43,000”. You must type “43000”. If there is a comma, python will interpret it as (43, 0), two separate values.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.2 VARIABLES</b></br>You can also manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a value. You can assign a variable a value using the “=” sign. However, don’t mix this up with the <i>equals</i> sign, which is “==”.</p>
<p class = "sansserif">Don’t forget, these variables are only to help “remember” the important values. When we manipulate them, they can change over time like in loops(you’ll learn more about this later).</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.3 VARIABLE NAMES AND KEYWORDS</b></br> It is important to remember when naming your variables, that you don’t name the variable a word that is an inbuilt function of python. The way to name a variable is that it should include letters and digits. It should start with an underscore or letter. Uppercase letter are allowed to be used in variable names, however you need to be aware that Python is a case sensitive programming language. Which means if you labeled the sentence food = “I love ice cream” then you cannot expect that the variable Food will equal to “I love ice cream”. Python will give you a name error if you accidently made that mistake. <p class = “sansserif”></p>
<p class = "sansserif"> The keywords in python that you may not use in python: False, True, def, if, raise, else, elif, None, del, import, return, in, try, and, is, while, as, except, lambda, with, assert,  finally, nonlocal, yield, break, for, not, class, from, or, continue, global, and pass.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"> Another tip is that keywords in IDLE should show up as orange.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.4 STATEMENTS</b></br> A statement is an instruction that Python can interpret and execute. Some examples that you’ll see soon are while statements, for statements, if statements, and import statements. There a lot of other though. When you write statements on a command line, Python will execute it. However, the statements themselves do not have any result.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.5 EVALUATING EXPRESSION</b></br>An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and can call to functions. For example, len is a function that returns the number of characters in a string. What produces a value is the <i>evaluation of an expression</i>. A value or variable by itself will simply be a value or variable.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.6 OPERATORS AND OPERANDS</b></br>Operators act like calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The values used by the operators are called operands. You can use variables in equations, as it will simply be replaced with the value assigned to that variable.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.7 TYPE CONVERTER FUNCTIONS</b></br> Here we will learn how to convert a certain data type into a different type. For example let’s say that you want 17 which is an integer to become a float. Then you write float(17). Then the output when you print this command will be 17.0. You could do the same thing with int() and str().  </p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.8 OPERATIONS</b></br> The operations and their symbols in python: Addition is +. Subtraction is -. Multiplication is *. Division is /. And exponent is **.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.9 OPERATIONS ON STRINGS</b></br>You can’t execute mathematical operations on strings, even when they look like numbers. However, the “+” sign works on strings, but not in addition, but concatenation. This means joining the two strings by linking them end to end. If you use print(“hi” * 3), you will get “hi” + “hi” + “hi”.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.10 INPUT</b></br> Input is a built in function that lets the user input something. You can have n = input(“Enter your name:”). This will let the user enter something. You will see “Enter your name:”.</p>
<p class = "sansserif"><b>2.11 THE MODULUS OPERATOR</b></br>The modulus operator is an operation that works with mod. For example if the number is 50 and you want to find the answer in mod 10, then you would do 55%10. This would result in the answer to be 5. </p>
