<p class = "sansserif"><b>5.1 BASIC TURTLE PROGRAM</b></p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    Let’s write a couple of lines of Python program to create a new turtle and start drawing a rectangle. (We’ll call the variable that refers to our first turtle alex, but we can choose another name if we follow the naming rules from the previous chapter).
</p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    <font size="4">
        <xmp>
            import turtle             # Allows us to use turtles
            wn = turtle.Screen()      # Creates a playground for turtles
            alex = turtle.Turtle()    # Create a turtle, assign to alex
            
            alex.forward(50)          # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
            alex.left(90)             # Tell alex to turn left by 90 degrees
            alex.forward(30)          # Complete the second side of a rectangle
            
            wn.mainloop()             # Wait for user to close window
        </xmp>
    </font>
</p>

<p class = "sansserif">
    If you copy and paste this program into a new IDLE module, and run it, it doesn’t run in the shell like our programs so far: instead, a new window pops up! (If you run it here in the ebook by clicking the “Run” button, a simulation of this window will appear within the book.)
    <br>
    Here are a couple of things we’ll need to understand about this program. (Don’t worry if you don’t understand them all now—we’ll cover them in more detail as we work through the book.)
    <br>    
    The first line tells Python to load a module named turtle. That module brings us two new types that we can use: the Turtle type, and the Screen type. The dot notation turtle.Turtle means “The Turtle type that is defined within the turtle module”. (Remember that Python is case sensitive, so the module name, with a lowercase t, is different from the type Turtle.)
    <br>    
    We then create and open what it calls a screen (we would prefer to call it a window), which we assign to variable wn. Every window contains a canvas, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.
    <br>    
    In line 3 we create a turtle. The variable alex is made to refer to this turtle.
    <br>    
    So these first three lines have set things up, we’re ready to get our turtle to draw on our canvas.
     <br>   
    In lines 5-7, we instruct the object alex to move, and to turn. We do this by invoking, or activating, alex‘s methods — these are the instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.
    <br>    
    The last line plays a part too: the wn variable refers to the window shown above. When we invoke its mainloop method, it enters a state where it waits for events (like keypresses, or mouse movement and clicks). The program will terminate when the user closes the window. (Note: in our ebook, you can’t “close” the turtle window once it’s open. The wn.mainloop() line is there for when you run the program on your own computer inside of IDLE. If you leave it out, then your turtle program will never terminate, and you’ll have to shut down IDLE to continue working.)
    <br>    
    An object can have various methods — things it can do — and it can also have attributes (sometimes called properties). For example, each turtle has a color attribute. The method invocation alex.color("red") will make alex red, and drawing will be red too.
    <br>    
    The color of the turtle, the width of its pen, the position of the turtle within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its current state. Similarly, the window object has a background color, and some text in the title bar, and a size and position on the screen. These are all part of the state of the window object.
    <br>    
    Quite a number of methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and the window objects. We’ll just show a couple. In this program we’ve only commented those lines that are different from the previous example (and we’ve used a different variable name for this turtle):
</p>

<p class = "sansserif">
    <font size="4">
        <xmp>
            import turtle
            wn = turtle.Screen()
            wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")      # Set the window background color
            wn.title("Hello, Tess!")      # Set the window title
            
            tess = turtle.Turtle()
            tess.color("blue")            # Tell tess to change her color
            tess.pensize(3)               # Tell tess to set her pen width
            
            tess.forward(50)
            tess.left(120)
            tess.forward(50)
            
            wn.mainloop()
        </xmp>
    </font>
</p>

<p class = "sansserif"><b>5.2 TURTLE TRICKS</b></p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    Turtle methods can use negative angles or distances. So tess.forward(-100) will move tess backwards, and tess.left(-30) turns her to the right. Additionally, because there are 360 degrees in a circle, turning 30 to the left will get tess facing in the same direction as turning 330 to the right! (The on-screen animation will differ, though — you will be able to tell if tess is turning clockwise or counter-clockwise!)
    <br>
    This suggests that we don’t need both a left and a right turn method — we could be minimalists, and just have one method. There is also a backward method. (If you are very nerdy, you might enjoy saying alex.backward(-100) to move alex forward!)
    <br>    
    Part of thinking like a computer scientist is to understand more of the structure and rich relationships in our field. So revising a few basic facts about geometry and number lines, and spotting the relationships between left, right, backward, forward, negative and positive distances or angles values is a good start if we’re going to play with turtles.
    <br>    
    A turtle’s pen can be picked up or put down. This allows us to move a turtle to a different place without drawing a line. The methods are
    <br>
    <font size="4">
        <xmp>
            import turtle
            wn = turtle.Screen()         # Set up the window and its attributes
            alex = turtle.Turtle()       # Create alex
            
            alex.penup()
            alex.forward(100)     # This moves alex, but no line is drawn
            alex.pendown()
            
            wn.mainloop()
        </xmp>
    </font>
</p>

<p class = "sansserif">
    Every turtle can have its own shape. The shapes available are arrow, blank, circle, classic, square, triangle, turtle.
    <font size="4">
        <xmp>
            import turtle             # Allows us to use turtles
            wn = turtle.Screen()      # Creates a playground for turtles
            alex = turtle.Turtle()    # Create a turtle, assign to alex
            
            alex.shape("turtle")      # Shape alex to look like a turtle
            
            alex.forward(50)          # Tell alex to move forward by 50 units
            alex.left(90)             # Tell alex to turn by 90 degrees
            alex.forward(30)          # Complete the second side of a rectangle
            
            wn.mainloop()             # Wait for user to close window
        </xmp>
    </font>
</p>

<p class = "sansserif">
    We can speed up or slow down the turtle’s animation speed. (Animation controls how quickly the turtle turns and moves forward). Speed settings can be set between 1 (slowest) to 10 (fastest). But if we set the speed to 0, it has a special meaning — turn off animation and go as fast as possible.
    <font size="4">
        <xmp>
            alex.speed(10)
        </xmp>
    </font>
</p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    A turtle can “stamp” its footprint onto the canvas, and this will remain after the turtle has moved somewhere else. Stamping works, even when the pen is up.
    <br>
    Let’s do an example that shows off some of these new features all together:
    <br>
    <font size="4">
        <xmp>
            import turtle
            wn = turtle.Screen()
            wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
            tess = turtle.Turtle()
            tess.shape("turtle")
            tess.color("blue")
            
            tess.penup()
            size = 20
            for i in range(30):
                tess.stamp()             # Leave an impression on the canvas
                size = size + 3          # Increase the size on every iteration
                tess.forward(size)       # Move tess along
                tess.right(24)           #  ...  and turn her
            
            wn.mainloop()
        </xmp>
    </font>
</p>
<p class = "sansserif">
    Be careful now! How many times was the body of the loop executed? How many turtle images do we see on the screen? All except one of the shapes we see on the screen here are footprints created by stamp. But the program still only has one turtle instance — can you figure out which one here is the real tess? (Hint: if you’re not sure, write a new line of code after the for loop to change tess‘ color, or to put her pen down and draw a line, or to change her shape, etc.)
